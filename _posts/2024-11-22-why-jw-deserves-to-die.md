# Why John Wick Totally Deserves to Die (And I Say That as a Huge Fan)

Before you get defensive, let me start by saying I love John Wick. It’s one of my favorite movie franchises. The action? Incredible. The cars? Stunning, even though they all end up destroyed. John himself? Quiet, deadly, and always impeccably dressed. I even enjoyed *The Continental* series, which I’m pretty sure only a handful of people watched.

That said, as much as I adore these movies, let’s face it: John Wick should not have survived as long as he did. I’m not just talking about his symbolic “I’m free now” death in Chapter 4. No, I mean he should’ve realistically died much, much earlier. Let me explain.

## Reason 1: The Car Wrecks Should Have Done Him In  
John Wick destroys cars like  I lose socks: frequently and without much thought. The number of high-speed crashes, flips, and rollovers he survives is absurd. Even the best stunt drivers would have trouble walking away from the wreckage he creates. But John? He gets up, brushes himself off, and keeps going. How?!

---

## Reason 2: No One Survives That Much Damage  
From being hit by cars to tumbling down countless stairs, John Wick takes a beating like no other. A normal person would be laid up in the hospital—if not the morgue. Yet John just keeps going, as if his body doesn’t understand the concept of breaking. Would it have killed the writers to at least give him a limp?

---

## Reason 3: What’s His Problem With Windows?  
John Wick seems to have a personal vendetta against glass. He’s constantly throwing himself through windows, whether it’s to escape or to attack. For most people, this would result in serious injuries—cuts, bruises, maybe even a broken bone or two. But for John, it’s just another Tuesday.

---

## Reason 4: Life-Threatening Injuries Are Barely a Bump in the Road  
Let’s not forget the time he fell off The Continental in Chapter 3—a fall that should have killed him. Yet there he was, getting back up (albeit with a limp) and ready for more action. Add in the stab wounds, gunshots, and other life-threatening injuries he’s survived, and you have to wonder: is he even human?

---

## Reason 5: Maybe Pets and Revenge Don’t Mix  
I get it. The first movie’s premise—avenging his dog—was deeply emotional and relatable. But after that, maybe he should have reconsidered adopting more pets. His life isn’t exactly conducive to responsible pet ownership. I can’t help but feel sorry for any animal that ends up in his care.

---

## Reason 6: He Never Learns From His Mistakes  
A lot of John’s trouble in Chapter 2 could have been avoided if he had just walked away. Instead, he blows up Santino D’Antonio’s house, setting off a chain reaction that leads to even more chaos. At some point, you have to wonder if he’s making things harder for himself on purpose.

---

## Reason 7: His Death Felt… Underwhelming  
After surviving so many insane situations, how does John Wick finally die? A duel. While it’s emotional and symbolic, it feels anticlimactic compared to the over-the-top action we’ve come to expect. Wouldn’t it have been more fitting for him to go out in a blaze of glory, taking down an army of assassins?

---

## Final Thought: Is He Even Human?  
Maybe the only explanation for John Wick’s resilience is his background. Born in the Byelorussian SSR, it’s fun to imagine some secret Soviet program for creating indestructible assassins. That would explain a lot.

In the end, I’ll always love the John Wick series. It’s thrilling, ridiculous, and endlessly entertaining. But even as a devoted fan, I have to admit that John Wick’s survival stretches the limits of believability. What do you think? Should he have died earlier, or do you love the chaos of his impossible resilience?
