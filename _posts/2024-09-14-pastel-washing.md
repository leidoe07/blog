# Pastel Washing; Learning JavaScript to Make a Simple Game


The name ‘Pastel Washing’ kinda sucks. Its the name of a game I made for a school assignment.  The name was originally supposed to be  something along the lines of “Bub’s Bubbly Machinery” but my name isn't Bub and I don't know Bub. Coding with JavaScript (when you're a beginner)  also sucks — especially when you're easily confused by the  multiple contradictions of data that you have to check for. And yet the ability to actually learn things pulled through and made the clicker one of the more enjoyable projects to build.

The first part of this project was obviously planning.

 I already knew I was creating a clicker game(via teacher’s instructions) but had no idea what the theme of the games should be. Before this project, the only clicker game I knew of was Cookie Clicker. Because of this I first considered a Bakery, thought it would be unoriginal and pivoted to a cult theme because I had just finished the main story of cult of the lamb but decided it was  too raunchy for a school project. I eventually thought of a laundry theme because it is the only chore I enjoy doing.

 This Next part was planning the attributes of the game. I decided the  button the players would click  on was a giant  washing machine.I also decided on the following attributes for the tool players could use.

            detergentPod: "Increases score by 1 every 3 seconds",

            powderDetergent: "Increases score by 7 every 10 seconds",

            basicSoap: "Increases score by 2 every 5 seconds",

            fabricSoftener: "Increases score by 5 every 7 seconds",
            
            bleach: "Increases score by 10 every 15 seconds",

            stainRemover: "Increases score by 15 every 20 seconds",

            scentBooster: "Increases score by 20 every 25 seconds",

            washingMachineCleaner: "Increases score by 25 every 30 seconds",

            dryerSheets: "Increases score by 30 every 35 seconds"


Then, I decided on the color scheme. At first, I considered using  a neon color scheme ,however, it  seemed to loud for the calm vibe I wanted  for the game. Because of this, I  one a mostly beige color scheme with pops of purple green and minty blue to make sure the game wasn't too bland. 

I created a collage on canva to give myself a  loose idea of what I wanted the game to look like.

To start the project, I used a  Css grid layout generator https://grid.layoutit.com/ to automatically generate the code for the game’s layout. 

To create the icons for the the game’s buttons I started drawing on  the  Procreate editor app but drawing the art  well enough to use ass icons. I started using Canva to find visuals suitable for game buttons and make minor adjustment to color and size. Next I  created the game buttons by using the  button class  in the specific section of the grid layout I created.
