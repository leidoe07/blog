# **Black Noir and the Social Issues It Comments On**

Black-led horror, or *Horror Noir*, focuses on narratives of Black and African American characters, often linking social, political, and economic issues to horror themes. These films not only entertain but serve as powerful vehicles for truth-telling, exploring systemic oppression, racism, police violence, and exploitation through the lens of fear and survival. Below are deeper insights into some key films in the genre and their commentary on social issues.

## **Candyman (1992 & 2021)**  

### **The Candyman Himself:**  
In both the 1992 original and the 2021 reboot, *Candyman* offers more than just supernatural scares. The titular character embodies racial trauma and collective suffering, manifesting as a vengeful spirit haunting Cabrini-Green, a predominantly Black public housing project in Chicago. 

In the original film, Candyman’s backstory is rooted in racial violence. He was a successful Black artist in the 19th century who was tortured and lynched by a white mob for falling in love with a white woman. His unjust death cements him as a symbol of racial pain, and his presence continues to haunt Cabrini-Green, which itself is depicted as a space segregated and abandoned by systemic neglect.

The 2021 reboot modernizes the narrative, shifting its focus to themes of gentrification and historical erasure. Cabrini-Green is no longer a housing project; it’s been transformed into a gentrified urban neighborhood for wealthy white residents. Despite these changes, Candyman remains—a spectral reminder that the trauma of racism doesn’t simply disappear with redevelopment.


### **Candyman (2021) – The Police Coercion Scene:**  
One of the film’s most harrowing moments comes when a police officer blackmails a character into supporting a false version of events after the shooting of a Black man. The officer threatens the character with life imprisonment if he doesn’t comply. This scene underscores how law enforcement is often complicit in manipulating narratives to cover up violence against Black individuals.

Candyman emerges as a "necessary evil" in this context—a force of vengeance responding to a broken justice system that routinely fails Black communities.

### **Commentary on Police Violence:**  
Both the 1992 and 2021 films make pointed commentary on violence against Black men, though the latter does so more explicitly. The reboot depicts two graphic scenes in which Black men are shot by police without hesitation. This imagery speaks directly to the real-world horror of police brutality, reminding viewers of high-profile cases such as those of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others.

By positioning Candyman as a figure who exacts revenge on those complicit in oppression, the film turns a traditional horror villain into a complex, morally ambiguous character representing both fear and justice.

## **Nope (2022)**  

### **Inspirations and Themes:**  
Jordan Peele, a master of modern social horror, described *Nope* as a film inspired by classics such as *King Kong*, *Jaws*, *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, and *The Wizard of Oz*. These films explore themes of spectacle, human arrogance, and the consequences of exploiting nature. Peele’s interpretation integrates these ideas with commentary on exploitation within the entertainment industry and society's obsession with spectacle.



### **The Horse Incident:**  
Early in the film, a horse on a Hollywood set becomes agitated when a crew member makes direct eye contact with it. This seemingly minor moment symbolizes humanity’s tendency to disregard the natural instincts of animals, assuming they will conform to human expectations.

The horse’s reaction foreshadows the central conflict of the film, where humans attempt to control and exploit a mysterious entity without understanding its nature.


### **The Monkey:**  
The flashback to the *Gordy’s Home* tragedy is one of the film's most unsettling scenes. Gordy, a chimpanzee trained to perform on a sitcom, violently attacks the cast after being triggered by the sound of popping balloons. The incident occurs because the production team failed to account for the unpredictability of animals under stress.

This scene critiques the entertainment industry's history of exploiting animals—and by extension, people—without regard for their well-being. It serves as a chilling reminder that the pursuit of spectacle often leads to catastrophe.



### **Jean Jacket:**  
The alien entity, called Jean Jacket, becomes a metaphor for the dangers of exploitation. Jupe, a former child actor who survived the Gordy incident, tries to commercialize Jean Jacket as a tourist attraction without understanding its true nature.

Much like he failed to learn from Gordy's attack, Jupe's attempt to profit from Jean Jacket ends in disaster. Peele uses this storyline to critique the entertainment industry's insatiable appetite for spectacle and its disregard for ethical boundaries.

## **Two Distant Strangers (2020)**  

### **Endless Loop of Violence:**  
This Oscar-winning short film follows Carter, a Black man trapped in a time loop where he is repeatedly killed by a white police officer. The film illustrates how Black people are often forced to navigate interactions with law enforcement carefully, knowing that any encounter could be fatal.

Despite trying every possible strategy—being polite, compliant, evasive, and even staying home—Carter is killed every time. This endless loop captures the frustration and trauma experienced by Black individuals who are taught that their survival depends on "behaving correctly" during police encounters.



### **Systemic Racism as Inescapable Horror:**  
The time loop structure of *Two Distant Strangers* symbolizes the inescapable nature of systemic racism. The film suggests that no amount of compliance or negotiation can guarantee safety for Black individuals in a society where racism is ingrained.

By blending science fiction elements with stark social commentary, the film forces viewers to confront the persistent and cyclical nature of police violence.

## **Broader Themes in Black Horror**  

### **Survival as Resistance:**  
In mainstream horror films, survival is often portrayed as a matter of luck, cleverness, or brute strength. In Black horror, survival takes on a deeper meaning—it becomes an act of resistance against systems designed to oppress and erase Black lives.

Films like *Get Out*, *Us*, and *Candyman* show Black characters fighting not just for their lives but for their dignity, identity, and autonomy.



### **Historical Trauma:**  
Many Black horror films explore how historical trauma continues to haunt marginalized communities. Whether it’s Candyman representing the pain of racial violence or the looping deaths in *Two Distant Strangers*, these films highlight the lasting impact of historical injustices.

This theme resonates with real-world issues such as redlining, mass incarceration, and police violence, which are rooted in historical systems of oppression.



### **Exploitation and Spectacle:**  
From Gordy’s tragic rampage in *Nope* to Jupe’s attempt to profit from Jean Jacket, Black horror often critiques the commodification of trauma and spectacle. These films remind viewers that exploitation—whether of animals, nature, or marginalized groups—comes with consequences.

Peele's films, in particular, explore how the entertainment industry capitalizes on Black pain for profit, turning it into a commodity for mass consumption.



## **Final Thoughts**  
Black-led horror films are not just about delivering scares—they are vehicles for truth-telling and social critique. They force audiences to confront societal horrors such as systemic racism, violence, and exploitation. By blending entertainment with powerful messages, these films amplify the voices and stories that need to be heard.

Filmmakers like Jordan Peele, Nia DaCosta, and others are redefining the horror genre, proving that horror can be both socially conscious and deeply impactful. These films remind us that the real world holds its own terrors—ones that must be acknowledged, confronted, and ultimately dismantled.
