Black Noir and the Social Issues It Comments On
Black-led horror, or Horror Noir, focuses on narratives of Black and African American characters, often linking social, political, and economic issues (like racism) to horror themes. Some of my favorite horror films are in this genre and often make me think deeply about the issues they explore. Here are some that come to mind and how they connect to certain social issues:

Candyman (1992 & 2021)
The Candyman Himself:
In both films, Candyman isn’t just a ghost or spirit—he’s a manifestation of the trauma and violence experienced by the people of Cabrini-Green. In the original, he represents the pain and horror born from historical racial violence.

Candyman (2021) – The Police Coercion Scene:
Towards the end of the movie, a police officer blackmails a character with the threat of life in jail, coercing him into supporting the officer’s false version of a Black man’s shooting. This scene highlights the skewed justice system, especially in impoverished neighborhoods, and portrays Candyman as a necessary evil—a force responding to systemic injustice.

Commentary on Police Violence:
It’s hard to ignore how the film directly comments on police violence—twice showing Black men shot on sight. It’s a stark reminder of the real-world horror of police brutality, making the legend of Candyman feel tragically relevant.

Nope (2022)
Inspirations and Themes:
Jordan Peele cited King Kong, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Jaws, Signs, and The Wizard of Oz as inspirations. All these movies explore themes of wild animals, exploitation, and the consequences of expecting them to act according to human standards.

The Horse Incident:
At the beginning, a horse gets startled because a human forgets that horses don’t like direct eye contact. It’s a small moment but symbolizes how we often misinterpret or disrespect nature, expecting it to bend to our will.

That Gosh Darn Monkey:
The tragedy on the Gordy’s Home set happens because no one remembered that animals react to loud sounds—like the popping balloons that triggered the chimpanzee’s freakout.

Jean Jacket:
Jupe tries to exploit the large, unknown being in the sky as his new attraction without understanding it—much like he didn’t learn his lesson from the Gordy incident. It’s a critique of how the entertainment industry exploits animals (and people) for spectacle, ignoring the inherent dangers.

Two Distant Strangers (2020)
Endless Loop of Violence:
The film shows how Black people are taught to interact with police officers just to survive encounters. The main character tries everything—staying home, avoiding the officer, even negotiating—but he still dies every time.

Systemic Racism as Inescapable Horror:
This film painfully illustrates that systemic racism isn’t something individuals can avoid or outsmart. It’s ingrained in society, and no amount of compliance can guarantee safety.

Final Thoughts:
Black-led horror films aren’t just about scares—they’re about truth-telling. They force us to confront real horrors like systemic racism and exploitation, using the genre to amplify voices and stories that need to be heard.
