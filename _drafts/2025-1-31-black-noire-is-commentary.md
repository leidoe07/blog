**Black Noir and the Social isssues it comments on**
Black led horror  or Horror noir can be defined as  a horror genre  that focuses on the narratives of black and african american characters often commenting social, political, and economic issues (such as but not limit to racism)  by connecting  them to themes and aspects of horror. 

Some of my favorite horror films are in this  genre and often make me  think deeply about...




Here some  that comes to mind aand how they connect to certain social issues

### Candyman
 The candy man  Himself  is    a   ghost or spirit summoned the subconscious of the people of cabrini green in reponse to the constant violence in the area.


 The original

 Candyman 2021
 Also towards the end of the movie a police officer blackmails a character with jail for life so coerced into going with his false story of what happened in one of the blackman shootings scenes.  This display of the skewed cop system often seen in impoverish neighborhoods is what allowed the movie to portray the candyman as a neccessary evil at the end of the movie




Note; it can also be  considered a commentary on police violences consiering a black man is shot on the spot in two scenes. Also 
 


### Nope

Jordan Peele cited King Kong (1933), Jurassic Park (1993), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Jaws (1975), Signs (2002), and The Wizard of Oz (1939) as his main inspirations. Palmer and Kaluuya joined in February 2021.
all off these movies have some themes of  wild animals, exploitation of them or consequences of expectaing them to act according to societie's standards asif they or human 

The horse at the begining 
a human forgot that horses dont like eye contact and caused the horse to startle


That gosh darn monkey

not a single person in that room remembered that  animals   reacted  to loud sounds  and popped balloons, causing the monkey's freak out.

Jean Jacket
Jupe didnt learn his lesson the first time and tried to  use the large unknown being in the sky that he barely saw and didnt even train as his newest exhibition



### Two Distant Strangers



The film portrayed the ways that Black people are taught to interact with police officers, in order to survive their encounters with them. For example, the main character of the film takes different actions during each and every one of his lives and still dies 100 times he tries, staying away from the office Visser staying in home, and even negotiating with the ops officer, but still get killed.
