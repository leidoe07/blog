# Why John Wick Deserves to Die

My favorite movie franchise is John Wick. I love everything about it - the violence , cars , lack of words from the main chracter- i even like the continental series even tho no one else seems to like. How ever , alot about the franchise  is RIDICULOUS - mostly the fact the John Wick didnt die half way through the first movies 














the fact that he survived all that make the death at the end of movie four look shoddie and pointless
